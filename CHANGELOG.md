# Changelog

## 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Quick Add popup** (`QuickAdd.ps1`) — system-wide WinForms dialog launchable from any context on the machine (browser, editor, spreadsheet, etc.)
  - Notebook dropdown pre-selected to active notebook
  - Multiline text box with vertical scrollbar
  - Ctrl+Enter to submit, Escape to cancel
  - Always-on-top window
- `Install-QuickAdd.ps1` — creates two Desktop shortcuts: Ctrl+Alt+A (Quick Add popup) and Ctrl+Alt+M (interactive menu)
- `Rebuild-Zip.ps1` — rebuilds MyJo.zip from the current repo contents; run before committing the ZIP

### Changed
- Chrome extension popup and right-click context menu now load notebooks dynamically from config via the native host — adding a new notebook is automatically reflected after restarting Chrome, no manual editing required

## 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Native messaging host now resolves `Journal.ps1` relative to its own location instead of hardcoding `~\Documents\MyJo` — works regardless of install path
- Chrome extension no longer permanently switches the active notebook when sending entries — saves and restores the previous active notebook

### Changed
- `com.myjo.host.json` removed from version control and added to `.gitignore` — it's machine-specific and generated by `install-host.ps1`
- README updated to use generic path in Chrome extension setup instructions
