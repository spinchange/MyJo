# Changelog

## 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Native messaging host now resolves `Journal.ps1` relative to its own location instead of hardcoding `~\Documents\MyJo` — works regardless of install path
- Chrome extension no longer permanently switches the active notebook when sending entries — saves and restores the previous active notebook

### Changed
- `com.myjo.host.json` removed from version control and added to `.gitignore` — it's machine-specific and generated by `install-host.ps1`
- README updated to use generic path in Chrome extension setup instructions
